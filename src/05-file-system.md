# File System

## Introducing the File System API

**We have much of our twitter app set up now - handling, inspecting and responding to these messages ('requests') is the core of our app, of Node, and of servers.**

* But, Node can do even more. We have an archive of tweets store in a huge file (1.5GB)
* Unfortunately they're saved on our computer, not in our little JavaScript-specific data store (JS memory)
* Could we load them in JavaScript to run a function that removes bad tweets?
* We can use `fs` to do so but there might be some issues with a file that large
