# Introduction

## The power of Node

* Most powerful technology in web development to emerge in 10 years
* Enables application that can handle millions of users without blocking
* From simple webpages to largest scaled applications, to Windows/Mac desktop apps (with Electron), and hardware (embedded systems)
* Allows us to build entire applications end-to-end in one language—JavaScript

## Node Overview

### Sending the right data back requires using multiple features of the computer

* Network socket- Receive and send back messages over the internet
* Filesystem- That's where the html/css/js code is stored in files
* CPU- for cryptography and optimizing hashing passwords
* Kernel- I/O management

Our dream—be able to use JavaScript to control this computer because (1) we know JavaScript and (2) it has some really nice design decisions

### Each programming language (PHP, Ruby, C++ JavaScript) have different levels of ability to interact with these features directly

C++ has many features that let it directly interact with the OS directly.

JavaScript does not! So it has to work with C++ to control these computers features. What is this combination known as? ... Node.js

JS -> Node -> Computer feature (e.g. network, file system)

## JavsScript, Node & The Computer

### We had better understand JavaScript to understand Node.js then

It's a language that does 3 things (and 1 involved a lot of help from C++)

1. Saves dta and functionality (code)
2. Uses that data by running functionality (code) on it
3. Has a ton of built-in labels that trigger Node features that are built in C++ to use our computer's internals
